DTM Race Driver

Filenames

Codes seem to work fine on xbox, I can't see any reason why they wont work on other platforms as there don't seem to be platform seeds for this keygen.  
But other platforms haven't been tested yet. PS2 might be fine but not sure.

Key  
Bonus: The bonus code presented at the bottom right of the screen in the bonus code menu,  
CARS: Unlocks all cars  
TRACKS: Unlocks all tracks  
CHAMPS: Unlocks all championships  
ALLPRD: Unlocks all pro race driver challenges  
NODENT: Disables vehicle damage  
EASYCAR: Easy car? Unsure what this does, maybe easy car handling.

Universal cheats  
There are some cheat codes that can work with any bonus code.  
CREDITS: View credits? Unsure why or what this does as you can already view the credits from the start? Might also be a cutscenes unlock?  
SIM: Enables realistic (or hard) car handling. Enabling this and EASYCAR at the same time may cause issues with unresponsive steering  
DAMAGE: Better damage?

Github was complaining the files where like 12KB over and wouldn't let me render them so I had to split them up sadly.

Sadly xbox codes seem to be only for xbox, I only quickly tested it on PS2 so I might be missing something.  
Also unsure about PSP? So I could just be missing the seeds for PS2 and PSP so that will need to be fixed at a later date.

Key  
Code: Your bonus code in Options -> Bonus -> Unlocking Information  
CHAMPS: Unlock all the cars and championships  
(except the last 3 bonus Championship)  
XCHAMPS: Unlock the 3 special bonus Championships and all the cars  
BOOST: Increase the overall speed of your car like a rocket booster  
FWDRIVE: Swap Front wheel drive cars to rear wheel drive and vice versa  
NODENT: Make the cars undamageable  
THEEND: Unlock all the cutscenes

There are currently no confirmed universal codes for this game.  
People have posted them, but none of them work for me so they might be for different platforms.
