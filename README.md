# Codemasters Cheat Database

Database of cheats for Codemasters games.  
Special thanks to vdox for the original generator.  
Special thanks to [Nenkai and Slient](https://github.com/Nenkai/GameCheat-Unlockers) for the CMR04 generator.

Also please note: Because of the size of these databases, they may take a little bit to load up, so just give it a sec.  
Codemasters never intended anyone to ever put all possible codes into one table. Hence why this hole "random" cheat codes in the first place,  
pay for cheats from Codemasters rather then get them from a book in the scholastic book fair, which was the style at the time. But we did it, we made a book out of every single cheat.  
But most things kinda struggle to read it. Even the split up data is a little to much for GitHub, but it does get there in the end, just have to give it a sec to load.

# TOCA Race Driver Cheats

aka  
TOCA 1  
V8 Supercars Australia  
DTM Race Driver

Filenames  
[TOCA1.csv](https://github.com/MobCat/Codemasters-Cheat-Database/blob/main/TOCA1.csv)

Codes seem to work fine on xbox, I can't see any reason why they wont work on other platforms as there don't seem to be platform seeds for this keygen.  
But other platforms haven't been tested yet. PS2 might be fine but not sure.

Key  
Bonus: The bonus code presented at the bottom right of the screen in the bonus code menu,  
CARS: Unlocks all cars  
TRACKS: Unlocks all tracks  
CHAMPS: Unlocks all championships  
ALLPRD: Unlocks all pro race driver challenges  
NODENT: Disables vehicle damage  
EASYCAR: Easy car? Unsure what this does, maybe easy car handling.

Universal cheats  
There are some cheat codes that can work with any bonus code.  
CREDITS: View credits? Unsure why or what this does as you can already view the credits from the start? Might also be a cutscenes unlock?  
SIM: Enables realistic (or hard) car handling. Enabling this and EASYCAR at the same time may cause issues with unresponsive steering  
DAMAGE: Better damage? Â

Github was complaining the files where like 12KB over and wouldn't let me render them so I had to split them up sadly.

Sadly xbox codes seem to be only for xbox, I only quickly tested it on PS2 so I might be missing something.  
Also unsure about PSP? So I could just be missing the seeds for PS2 and PSP so that will need to be fixed at a later date.

Key  
Code: Your bonus code in Options -> Bonus -> Unlocking Information  
CHAMPS: Unlock all the cars and championships  
(except the last 3 bonus Championship)  
XCHAMPS: Unlock the 3 special bonus Championships and all the cars  
BOOST: Increase the overall speed of your car like a rocket booster  
FWDRIVE: Swap Front wheel drive cars to rear wheel drive and vice versa  
NODENT: Make the cars undamageable  
THEEND: Unlock all the cutscenes

There are currently no confirmed universal codes for this game.  
People have posted them, but none of them work for me so they might be for different platforms.

# Colin McRae Rally 04 Cheats

Well this turned into a clusta trash fire...  
Folder of cheat codes [here](https://github.com/MobCat/Codemasters-Cheat-Database/tree/main/Colin%20McRae%20Rally%2004%20Cheats)  
It would seem that Codemasters increased the bonus code from 5 digits to 6, this increased the amount of possible codes by 10x  
So instead of 2 CSVs we now have 20... fun..  
I realize this isn't ideal, but its all I got right now. I need to come back to this and just re-wright the algorithm in php rather then dumping all possible codes to a table.

key  
Bonus: The Secret access code the game generates for you in the cheat menu (Options -> Secrets. This is not in the Extras menu)  
GROUP B: Group B with 2 cars (Unlocks Group B events and 2 Group B cars.)  
CARS: All Cars (Unlocks the rest of the cars)  
TRACKS: All Tracks  
EXPERT: Expert Mode  
PARTS: Auto - Upgrades (All car parts)  
TESTS: All Tests  
MIRROR: Mirror tracks mode
